The appellant complained that the company, in response to his access request, provided an incomplete dataset in English. The DPA found that much of the data that the complainant found as missing is data that the complainant is expected to possess. So, it concluded that the company is not obliged to provide data that the data subject already possesses under Articles 13(4) and 14(5) GDPR. Thus, the DPA found that the company has adequately fulfilled the obligation to inform the data subject of the data processing as required by Articles 13-15 GDPR.

Article 59 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic",,,,"Jose Belo","A balance of fundamental rights case where a data subject (employee) requests personal data of other data subjects (employees) from the controller (employer) to defend her/his constitutional right to equal pay for equal work.  Claiming a violation of the universal principle of equality of ""for equal, work equal pay"", protected by the Portuguese Constitution (Article 59), a plaintiff, seeking higher remuneration, requested access to salary receipts of other workers from the employer, to prove that his constitutional rights were being violated.  After the request, made to the lower Court, to obtain the personal data from other data subjects that are employees of the controller and not part of the litigation, the Court decided against the sharing of personal data for the purposes of civil litigation, claiming the right to privacy of the other data subjects. The Attorney General agreed with the decision.  The data subject appealed this particular decision.  The Court of Appeal considered that, even though the other data subjects are not part of the litigation, it is no less true that all people, whether or not they are parties to the cause, have a duty to collaborate to the discovery the truth (Article 417(1) of the (New) Civil Procedural Code).  The Court of Appeal decided that the controller must provide their personal data, so that the Courts are able to understand and decide upon the data subject's initial claim that the controller is not paying the same to its employees for equal work.  Taking into consideration the fundamental right to privacy of those data subjects that are not part of the litigation, the Court of Appeal decided that the controller provide the personal data requested by the data subject, but to apply data minimisation techniques that only allow the Court to decide, removing any other personal data from the submitted salary receipts of other data subjects.  As such, the Court ordered that any reference to any other elements that are not related to the salary (i.e. union dues, insurance and alimony payments and absences from work) and that may be included in the receipts, should be removed.  The Court of Appeal, thus, considered the appeal well founded."
