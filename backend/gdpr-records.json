According to the data protection authority, personal data of tenants were stored without checking whether storage was permissible or even necessary and it was therefore possible to access personal data of affected tenants which had been stored for years without this data still serving the purpose of its original collection. This involved data on the personal and financial circumstances of tenants, such as salary statements, self-disclosure forms, extracts from employment and training contracts, tax, social security and health insurance data as well as bank statements. In addition to sanctioning this structural violation, the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases. See the separate entry. *** UPDATE *** On 24 February 2021 the Berlin Regional Court has dismissed the fine against Deutsche Wohnen SE due to procedural errors, see <a class='blau' href='https:\/\/www.deutsche-wohnen.com\/ueber-uns\/presse-news\/pressemitteilungen\/landgericht-berlin-stellt-bussgeldverfahren-gegen-deutsche-wohnen-ein\/' target='_blank'>link<\/a> and <a class='blau' href='https:\/\/www.heise.de\/news\/Gravierende-Maengel-Deutsche-Wohnen-wendet-DSGVO-Millionenstrafe-vorerst-ab-5064633.html' target='_blank'>link<\/a>","fine_amount":0.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Real Estate","gh_id":164.0,"et_id":"ETid-98"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=BlnBDI_-_Deutsche_Wohnen_SE_decision","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-99","sources":["https:\/\/www.datenschutz-berlin.de\/fileadmin\/user_upload\/pdf\/pressemitteilungen\/2019\/20191105-PM-Bussgeld_DW.pdf"],"companies":["Deutsche Wohnen SE"],"summary":"The Berlin DPA (BlnBDI) fined the real estate company Deutsche Wohnen SE \u20ac 14.5 million for violation of Article 5(1)(e) and Article 25(1) GDPR as the company's archive system was structurally unable to delete unnecessary data.In addition to sanctioning violations of privacy by design principles (Art. 5 GDPR, Art. 25 GDPR - see separate entry), the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases.","fine_amount":14500000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Real Estate","gh_id":164.0,"et_id":"ETid-99"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=HDPA_-_36\/2019","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["Forthnet"],"summary":"The HDPA re-examined complaints against the Greek internet and telecommunications service provider Forthnet.gr upon appeal and decided to reduce the fine it had previously imposed on it.","fine_amount":2400022000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"","gh_id":174.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Commissioner_-_patient_data_on_Instagram","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["Anonymous"],"summary":"The Commissioner fined  a doctor \u20ac 14,000 for publishing sensitive patient data on Instagram.","fine_amount":14000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"","gh_id":177.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=UODO_-_ZSPR.421.7.2019","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-102","sources":["https:\/\/uodo.gov.pl\/decyzje\/ZSPR.421.7.2019"],"companies":["ClickQuickNow Sp. z o"],"summary":"The UODO imposed a fine of ca \u20ac47,000  on a limited liability company ClickQuickNow Sp. z o. o. for preventing the exercise of the right to withdraw consent.The UODO imposed a fine of EUR 47000 for obstructing the exercise of the right of withdrawal for the processing of personal data.

Furthermore, irregularities in data processing in connection with competitions were also complained about. In addition, incorrect and non-transparent information on data processing was provided in Apps provided by the Company and invalid methods of consent were used. In some cases, paper forms requesting one single consent were used for various purposes, including marketing. Furthermore, data was kept longer than necessary and thus violated deletion periods. \n\nFor these violations, the telecommunications company received a fine of EUR 27.8 million. Among other things, the fine was imposed for: lack of consent for marketing activities (telemarketing and cold calling), addressing of data subjects who asked not to be contacted with marketing offers, invalid consents collected in TIM apps, lack of appropriate security measures to protect personal data (including incorrect exchange of blacklists with call centres), lack of clear data retention periods.

Here, according to the findings of the Hamburg data protection officer, since at least 2014 private life circumstances of some of the employees have been comprehensively recorded and this information stored on a network drive. For example, the company conducted a 'Welcome Back Talk' after employees returned to work after vacation or illness. The information that became known in this context - including information on the symptoms of illness and diagnoses of the employees - was recorded and stored. In addition, according to the Hamburg data protection authority, some supervisors also used the 'Flurfunk' [meaning to hear something through the grapevine] to acquire a broad knowledge of individual employees, for example about family problems and religious beliefs. The information stored on the network drive was accessible to up to 50 managers of the company and was used, among other things, to evaluate the work performance of the employees and to make employment decisions.The data collection became known due to a technical configuration error in October 2019, according to which the data stored on the network drive was accessible company-wide for several hours. After the violation became known, the management apologized to the employees and offered monetary compensation.

As a result, the attacker(s) had access to vast amounts of costumers\u2019 personal data: Marriot estimated that they accessed 339 million guest records, with 30.1 million being EEA members\u2019 records and 7 million being associated with the UK.Original Summary: The ICO issued a notice of its intention to fine Marriott International Inc due to a cyber incident which was notified to the ICO by Marriott in November 2018. A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.\n\nIt is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO\u2019s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.\n\n--> Update: On 2020\/10\/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of \u00a3 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.","fine_amount":20450000.0,"fine_currency":"GBP","sector":"Accomodation and Hospitalty","gh_id":2852.0,"et_id":"ETid-60"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=DPC_-_Tusla_Child_and_Family_Agency","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"The Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) fined Tusla (the Irish Child and Family Agency) \u20ac75000 for \u201cunintentionally providing\u201d the personal data of children to third parties in three separate incidents.","fine_amount":40000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"","gh_id":2864.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=AEPD_(Spain)_-_PS\/00341\/2020","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-435","sources":["https:\/\/www.aepd.es\/es\/documento\/ps-00341-2020.pdf"],"companies":["Vodafone ESPA\u00d1A, S.A.U."],"summary":"The Spanish DPA (AEPD) held that Vodafone infringed Article 6(1) GDPR by sending the complainant an SMS asking for the payment of a fraudulent contractual service.

The Italian National Institute for Social Security had been tasked with anti-fraud investigations related to COVID-19 relief funds. After press reports raised problems with the institute's data processing practices around the application review of politicians, the Italian DPA opened an investigation against INPS in August 2020. During that investigation, the DPA identified several violations. \n\nThe controller had collected data on tens of thousands of politicians from public sources and cross-checked it with data from applicants. In doing so, however, the controller had failed to ensure that data was collected only from those politicians who were eligible to receive the assistance funds. In doing so, the controller violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency as set out in the GDPR.\n\nFurthermore, the controller had violated the principle of data minimization by initiating checks on reimbursements even for individuals whose applications had been rejected and who had therefore never received payments.\n\nFurthermore, the controller had not adequately assessed the risks associated with a data processing operation as sensitive as that on applications for social benefits, since it had not carried out an impact assessment on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Update: Following an appeal presented by INPS the judge of the XVIII civil section of the Court of Rome annulled the fine of EUR 300,000.","fine_amount":300000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Public Sector and Education","gh_id":3235.0,"et_id":"ETid-591"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Garante_per_la_protezione_dei_dati_personali_-_9544504","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-559","sources":["https:\/\/www.garanteprivacy.it\/web\/guest\/home\/docweb\/-\/docweb-display\/docweb\/9544504"],"companies":["Azienda USL della Romagna","Anonymous"],"summary":"The Italian DPA (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali) imposed a fine of \u20ac50,000 to Azienda USL della Romagna, a local public health care provider, for contacting a patient at a phone number different from the one she expressly requested to be contacted at.The Italian DPA (Garante) imposed a fine of EUR 50,000 on Azienda USL della Romagna.

Since several hundred thousand people use public transportation in Stockholm every day, a large number of people were thus at risk of being monitored by video and audio recordings.\n\nThe DPA believes that body-worn camera technology could be used to prevent and document threatening situations, but that the pre-recording time should be reduced to a maximum of 15 seconds, as a longer pre-recording time is not necessary to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. Furthermore the DPA found that audio recordings did not contribute to the identification of persons without a valid ticket. The DPA therefore considered the audio recordings to be a violation of the principles of legality and transparency as well as data minimization.

Medhelp was contracted by three Swedish regions to answer calls from the medical advice hotline 1177. Medhelp violated the GDPR by exposing an unprotected server with patient data to the internet, failing to provide enough information about the transfer of data to a third country, and failing to continuously back up patient data. In addition, Medhelp employed a subcontractor to process data in Thailand contrary to Swedish healthcare law.The Swedish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 1,200,000 on MedHelp AB. The fine is related to an investigation against three companies and three Swedish regions. \n\nIn all 21 regions of Sweden, a telephone hotline that offers advice on various health-related topics can be reached by dialing 1177. Each region operates its own health advice service, either internally or through contracted subcontractors, but together they form a national network.\nIn 2019, the media reported that recorded calls to the 1177 helpline were available on a web server without password protection or other security measures. \nAll calls to the 1177 number initially went to the company Inera, which managed and developed the shared systems. Calls to the number 1177 from people living in the Stockholm, S\u00f6rmland and V\u00e4rmland regions were put through by Inera to Medhelp AB, which took the calls. Medhelp had in turn contracted the Thai company Medicall Co Ltd. to take calls on weekends and at night. Both Medhelp and Medicall had a contract with the technology company Voice Integrate Nordic AB for, among other things, call recordings. A data breach had then occurred in which recordings of calls to the number 1177 were available on the Internet on a storage server belonging to Voice Integrate. \nThe incident resulted from the misconfiguration of a network-attached storage device that was publicly accessible over the Internet and did not use encrypted communications. A large number of calls were accessed due to the vulnerability. \n\nThe Swedish DPA found that MedHelp had failed to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security to protect personal data so that unauthorized persons could not access it. Similarly, MedHelp had failed to properly inform callers about the processing of their personal data in accordance with Art. 13 GDPR. \n\nIn addition, the DPA finds the outsourcing of the processing of personal data to Medicall to be a breach of the legality principle set out in the GDPR. This is because Medicall is not covered by Swedish health and medical legislation and is therefore not subject to the legally regulated confidentiality obligation that exists in the Swedish healthcare sector.","fine_amount":1200000.0,"fine_currency":"SEK","sector":"Health Care","gh_id":3577.0,"et_id":"ETid-718"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=ANSPDCP_(Romania)_-_Fine_against_La_Santrade_S.R.L.","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-728","sources":["https:\/\/www.dataprotection.ro\/?page=Comunicat_Presa_16_06_2021&lang=ro"],"companies":["La Santrade S.R.L."],"summary":"The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) fined a controller approximately \u20ac2000 (RON 9839) for failing to provide the DPA with requested information during an investigation.

It ordered the company to bring its processing operations into compliance within 3 months.The Irish DPA (DPC) has imposed a fine of EUR 225,000,000 on WhatsApp Ireland Ltd. The DPA had started extensive investigations into the messaging service's compliance with transparency obligations back in December 2018. In this context, the DPC investigated whether WhatsApp complied with its obligations under the GDPR regarding the provision of information and the transparency of this information to users and non-users of WhatsApp. \n\nIn the course of the investigation, the DPC found that WhatsApp had committed serious violations of Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR with respect to the information provided to users. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other affected European supervisory authorities in December 2020. The DPC subsequently received objections from eight supervisory authorities. Due to lack of agreement, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR on June 3, 2021. \n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPB), by its decision of July 28, 2021, then, required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine based on a number of factors. The EDPS found a violation of the principle of transparency set forth in Article 5(1) a) of the GDPR in addition to the violations found by the DPC, and requested this to be reflected in the final amount of the fine. \n\nBased on this, the DPC imposed the fine in the amount of EUR 225,000,000. \n\nThe fine is composed as follows:\n\nEUR 90,000,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR;\nEUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 12 GDPR;\nEUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR; and\nEUR 75,000,000 for the violation of Art. 14 GDPR.\n\n\nWith respect to Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR, the DPC found that WhatsApp had failed to provide information about the nature of the data collection 'in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.' This includes making the information easy for children to understand when it is addressed to them. For example, WhatsApp had distributed information about the relationship between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies and the sharing of data under that relationship through a variety of texts. Much of the information provided was of such general nature, moreover, that the DPC deemed it meaningless. Users often had to overcome multiple links to FAQs to get to the information they were looking for on WhatsApp's website. In this regard, the DPC stated that it would be unreasonable to expect users to search the WhatsApp website after failing to find sufficient information in the privacy statement itself.\n\nWith regard to Art. 14 GDPR, one of the issues was the impact of a user's consent allowing the messaging platform to have access to his or her contacts. As such, the company searched its users' contact information on their phones for phone numbers and other data, not only from other WhatsApp users, but also from contacts who do not even have a WhatsApp account. The DPC finds that this data had been processed unlawfully, as these contacts (especially those who do not have a WhatsApp account) had not received any information about this processing and therefore could not possibly have given their consent. \n\nGiven the seriousness and the far-reaching nature and impact of the breaches, the DPA concluded that there had also been a violation of the transparency principle from Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR.","fine_amount":225000000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting","gh_id":3914.0,"et_id":"ETid-820"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=AEPD_(Spain)_-_PS\/00315\/2020","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["SIGNALLIA MARKETING DISTRIBUTION, S.A."],"summary":"The Spanish DPA fined a processor \u20ac100,000 for not complying with its obligation to delete and return all the personal data it held, as well as any existing copies, to the controller after ending its services as a processor.","fine_amount":100000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"","gh_id":3918.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=ICO_(UK)_-_Parkin_Beacher_Ltd","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["Parkin Beacher Ltd"],"summary":"The UK DPA fined a direct marketing company approximately \u20ac58,600 (\u00a350,000) for making illegal marketing calls to people about their pensions.","fine_amount":50000.0,"fine_currency":"GBP","sector":"","gh_id":3997.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=ICO_(UK)_-_DialADeal_Scotland_Ltd","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["DialADeal Scotland Ltd"],"summary":"The UK DPA fined a direct marketing company approximately \u20ac176,000 (\u00a3150,000) for making unsolicited direct marketing calls to subscribers who had not provided valid consent and previously notified the DPA that they do not want to received such calls.","fine_amount":150000.0,"fine_currency":"GBP","sector":"","gh_id":3999.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=AEPD_(Spain)_-_PS\/00161\/2021","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["'D.

On this basis, the DPA initiated an investigation into whether Ferde has implemented routines and measures to ensure adequate information security for the information transferred to China.\n\nAs part of its operations, Ferde is responsible for registering passages at toll booths. The registration is usually done by a chip in the car. If the chip in the car is not properly registered or the car does not have a chip, a photo of the car's license plate is taken.\n\nThese images are then sent to an automatic optical character recognition system to digitally read the license plate. In cases where the image quality is not good enough for automatic interpretation, the image is transmitted for manual processing. Ferde contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS), which also has employees in China, for this task. \n\nAfter its investigations, the DPA concluded that Ferde AS had violated a number of basic obligations of the GDPR for a period of 1-2 years. \n\nFor one thing, Ferde had not conducted a risk assessment before processing personal data and before using manual image processing by the processor. However, this would have been necessary to assess the risks associated with the transfer and to determine whether further security measures may be required. \n\nIn addition, the DPA found that Ferde had not entered into a proper processor contract regarding the processing of UBS.As a result, the transfer of the personal data in question to China took place without a valid legal basis. \nIn determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that a large amount of personal data was affected by the violation. On the other hand, the fact that no material or immaterial damage to the affected parties could be proven had a mitigating effect.","fine_amount":496000.0,"fine_currency":"NOK","sector":"Public Sector and Education","gh_id":4122.0,"et_id":"ETid-851"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=HmbBfDI_(Hamburg)_-_Vattenfall_Europe_Sales_GmbH","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"The Hamburg DPA fined Vattenfall Europe, an energy provider, \u20ac901,388 for violating Articles 12 and 13 GDPR by not informing their customers of data reconciliation sufficiently.","fine_amount":901389.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"","gh_id":4172.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Garante_per_la_protezione_dei_dati_personali_(Italy)_-_9704032","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"The Italian DPA imposed corrective measures and a fine of \u20ac5,000 on the Rome Provincial Order of Surgeons and Dentists, a medical industry body, for failing to reply to a data subject's access request under Article 15 GDPR regarding the processing of their personal data.","fine_amount":5000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"","gh_id":4208.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Datatilsynet_(Norway)_-_20\/01879","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-858","sources":["https:\/\/www.datatilsynet.no\/contentassets\/d01675e54b9447298952002ff1c208fb\/vedtak-om-overtredelsesgebyr---hoylandet-kommune.pdf","https:\/\/www.datatilsynet.no\/regelverk-og-verktoy\/lover-og-regler\/avgjorelser-fra-datatilsynet\/2021\/gebyr-til-hoylandet-kommune\/"],"companies":["H\u00f8ylandet kommune (municipality)"],"summary":"The Norwegian DPA fined a municipality \u20ac40,478 (NOK 400,000) for not managing a breach in which people with no affiliation to the municipality had their highly sensitive personal data exposed, thus breaching Article 32(1)(b) GDPR and Article 32(2), cf.

This could have potentially allowed the hacker to access data such as names, dates of birth, gender, email addresses, phone numbers, flight information and booking numbers of 25 million passengers. It was found that the hacker actually downloaded the personal data of 83,000 people. In 367 cases, the data included medical information of people who had requested, for example, wheelchair transportation or additional services because they were blind or deaf. The DPA noted that a lack of security measures allowed the hacker to access the systems. Thus, it was possible to access the airline's systems simply by entering the password. The systems did not incorporate multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, the access rights of the accounts were not limited to necessary systems, allowing the hacker to use them to gain access to multiple Transavia systems.

The CNIL also found a breach of the principle of storage limitation and data security.The French DPA (CNIL) imposed a fine of EUR 400,000 on RATP (the operator of the public transport system in Paris). In May 2020, a trade union filed a complaint with the CNIL alleging that the number of strike days exercised by staff were included in files used to prepare promotion decisions. The CNIL then conducted investigations in several RATP bus centers. These led to confirmation of this practice in three RATP bus centers. The CNIL indicated that files for evaluating performance and promotion prospects should only contain data necessary for evaluating employees.In particular, it was sufficient to indicate the total number of days of absence without the need to go into detail and distinguish the days associated with the exercise of the right to strike. It found that the use of data on the number of days staff members were on strike was not necessary for these purposes, and that the RATP thus violated the principle of data minimization set forth in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the RATP had excessively retained many of its employees' data. Indeed, the RATP kept files on the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission, although their retention was only required for 18 months after the holding of these commissions. Further, CNIL found that RATP did not adequately differentiate between staff authorization levels, allowing more staff than necessary to access certain data. For this reason, CNIL concluded that RATP failed in its duty to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.","fine_amount":400000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Transportation and Energy","gh_id":4329.0,"et_id":"ETid-910"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=CNPD_(Luxembourg)_-_D%C3%A9lib%C3%A9ration_n%C2%B0_35FR\/2021","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-894","sources":["https:\/\/cnpd.public.lu\/content\/dam\/cnpd\/fr\/decisions-fr\/2021\/Decision-35FR-2021-sous-forme-anonymisee.pdf"],"companies":[],"summary":"The Luxembourg DPA (CNPD) imposed a fine of \u20ac5300 on a company for using a video camera surveillance system on its premises and tracking devices in some of its employees' vehicles in breach of the information obligation set out in Article 13 GDPR and in breach of the principle of data minimisation set out in Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.The DPA from Luxembourg has imposed a fine of EUR 5,300 on a company.

Both the firm and the patients were blackmailed following these data breaches.The Finnish DPA has fined Vastaamo psychotherapy center EUR 608,000. In September 2020, the psychotherapy center reported an attack on its patient database to the DPA. An unauthorized third party had gained access to Vastaamo's medical database on at least two occasions, in December 2018 and March 2019. The attacker had also siphoned off data and left a ransom note on the servers. Due to insufficient logging, neither the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses used by the attacker could be identified.\n\nThe most likely cause of the medical database leak was an unprotected port on the database where the root user account of the database was not password protected.

Grindr is a location-based social networking app designed for gay, bi, trans and queer people.  In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority filed a complaint against Grindr with the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the portal had shared information about users' GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender with several third parties for marketing purposes. \n\nUnder GDPR, consent is required for the sharing of this personal data. However, during its investigation, the DPA found that the consent collected by Grindr was not valid. \n\nUsers had to accept the privacy policy in order to use the app, but were not explicitly asked whether they would consent to their data being shared with third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the information about the disclosure of personal data was not clear or accessible enough for users. \n\n\nThe DPA points out that this type of data may identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority.

Thus, the server access was not subject to any security measures, so that it was possible to access it via the Internet between November 2015 and February 2020\n\nIn addition, the DPA found that the company had failed to inform the data subjects about the data breach. \n\nThe CNIL also found that in several cases, contracts the company had concluded with processors were inadequately drafted, as they did not include certain envisaged clauses obliging the processors to process personal data in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR.","fine_amount":180000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Finance, Insurance and Consulting","gh_id":4517.0,"et_id":"ETid-971"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Garante_per_la_protezione_dei_dati_personali_(Italy)_-_9735672","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["Enel Energia Spa"],"summary":"The Italian DPA imposed multiple corrective measures and a fine of \u20ac26,513,977 on Enel Energia for unlawfully processing the personal data of millions of users for telemarketing purposes.","fine_amount":26513877.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"","gh_id":4518.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=HDPA_(Greece)_-_55\/2021","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["Ministry of Tourism"],"summary":"The Hellenic DPA fined the Ministry of Tourism \u20ac75,000 for not appointing a DPO nor reporting a data breach which allowed citizens who entered their credentials on a government platform to view the personal data of other people - including their full name, VAT number, social security number, postal address, telephone number, email, and disability status.","fine_amount":75000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"","gh_id":4527.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Datatilsynet_(Norway)_-_18\/04147","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen)"],"summary":"The Norwegian DPA initially notified the Public Roads Administration of a NOK 4 million fine for failing to delete toll road crossing logs, thus violating Article 5(1) GDPR, Article 17(1)(a), Article 17(1)(d) and Article 25(1), cf.

Additionally, the DPA held that the tax authority had violated several other GDPR provisions, as well as the principles of transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage limitation.The Dutch DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 3,7 million on the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. This is the highest fine ever imposed by the Dutch DPA\n\nAs part of its investigation, the DPA found a number of violations of the GDPR. \n\nThe Tax and Customs Administration had kept a list for several years on which it recorded indications of fraud. The list contained information on over 270,000 individuals, including minors. The administration had processed personal data such as health, citizenship, and criminal personal data as part of the list maintenance.\n\nThe DPA initially found that the administration did not have a valid legal basis for processing the data contained in the list. For this reason, the data were processed unlawfully. \n\nFurther, the DPA found that the information in the list was often incorrect, so that a large number of individuals were falsely registered as possible fraudsters. \n\nIn addition, the investigation revealed that the maintenance of the list led to discrimination against some individuals, as the risk of fraud was determined on the basis of the nationality and appearance of the data subjects, among other factors. For example, donations to mosques were considered a risk factor for fraud. \n\nFurthermore, the DPA found that the administration violated its obligation under the GDPR to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that ensure adequate protection of the personal data it collects. Indeed, the administration had inadequately secured the personal data. \n\nThe DPA also found that the administration had violated the principle of storage limitation by storing the data for a longer time contrary to the retention period established for the personal data in the list.\n\nFurthermore, the DPA found that the processing of the data in the list had not been necessary for the administration to properly perform its tasks. The processing was therefore disproportionate. Also, the administration had not sufficiently defined the purposes underlying the processing and thus violated the principle of purpose limitation. \n\nThe fine is composed as follows: \n\nEUR 1 million for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR;\nEUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR;\nEUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) d) GDPR;\nEUR 250,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR;\nEUR 500,000 for a breach of Art. 32 (1) GDPR\nEUR 450,000 for a breach of Art. 35 (2) GDPR.","fine_amount":3700000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Public Sector and Education","gh_id":4853.0,"et_id":"ETid-1124"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Garante_per_la_protezione_dei_dati_personali_(Italy)_-_9761383","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-1133","sources":["https:\/\/www.gpdp.it\/web\/guest\/home\/docweb\/-\/docweb-display\/docweb\/9761383"],"companies":[],"summary":"The Italian DPA issued a \u20ac8000 against a regional environmental agency for publishing a document which included a former employee's personal data related to criminal offenses on its website without a valid legal basis, in violation of Articles 5(1), 6 and 10 GDPR.The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined the Agenzia Regionale per la Tutela dell'Ambiente dell'Abruzzo EUR 8,000.

Two data subjects had complained to the DPA that Google had disclosed their personal data to third parties without authorization. \n\nIn the course of the lengthy investigation, the DPA found that Google had passed on personal data of data subjects to the so-called Lumen project. \n\nLumen is a project run by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. The project began in 2002 for the purpose of collecting requests relating to the removal of content from websites within and outside of the United States. This data may then be accessed by researchers and other interested parties. \n\nUsers of Google-operated platforms such as YouTube or Google Drive have the option of requesting that content about themselves on the platforms be removed. For this purpose, Google has provided various contact and complaint forms.\n\nHowever, the data of the data subjects who use these forms was automatically transmitted to the Lumen project. \nThe data subjects did not have the opportunity to object to this transmission, because the automatic transmission to Lumen was a condition for using the forms. \nFor this reason, the DPA found that, due to the lack of possibility to object to the transfer of the data to Lumen, Google processed the data subjects' data without a valid legal basis. \n\nIn this context, the DPA also found that Google did not sufficiently enable data subjects to exercise their right to erasure of their data. \n\nWhen assessing the fine, the DPA took into account as aggravating factors that the data was not only disclosed, but also transferred to a third country without giving the data subjects the possibility to object to it. This deprived the data subjects of control over the handling of their personal data. In addition, the DPA found that the transfer took place over a very long period of time. \nAlso, a large number of individuals were affected and in some cases sensitive data was processed.","fine_amount":10000000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting","gh_id":4943.0,"et_id":"ETid-1176"},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Garante_per_la_protezione_dei_dati_personali_(Italy)_-_9771142","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["Uber B.V.","Uber Technologies Inc."],"summary":"The Italian DPA fined Uber a total of \u20ac4,240,000 for violations relating to 1,500,000 data subjects in Italy, including lack of transparency and consent and failure to notify the DPA of a personal data breach.","fine_amount":4240000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"","gh_id":4946.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Datatilsynet_(Norway)_-_21\/00872","et_direct_url":"","sources":[],"companies":["NAV (the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration)"],"summary":"The Norwegian DPA fined the Labour and Welfare Administration \u20ac486,700 for publishing CVs and confidential personal data of 1,8 million data subject online without a legal basis, in breach of Articles 6(1), (3) and Article 5(1)(a), and 5(1)(f) GDPR.","fine_amount":5000000.0,"fine_currency":"NOK","sector":"","gh_id":4947.0,"et_id":null},{"gh_direct_url":"https:\/\/gdprhub.eu\/index.php?title=Datatilsynet_(Norway)_-_20\/02368","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-1181","sources":["https:\/\/www.datatilsynet.no\/contentassets\/08439c79981a499f86fd9faebac1855d\/20-02368-8-sladdet-versjon.pdf","https:\/\/www.datatilsynet.no\/regelverk-og-verktoy\/lover-og-regler\/avgjorelser-fra-datatilsynet\/2022\/gebyr-for-automatisk-videresending-av-e-post\/"],"companies":["Redacted"],"summary":"The Norwegian DPA fined a company \u20ac9,775 for unlawfully enabling automatic forwarding of an employee's emails in violation of Article 6(1)(f), for lack of information as per Article 13, failure to assess their objection as per Article 21, and required them to improve internals controls for employee emails as per Article 24 GDPR.The Norwegian DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 9,700 on a company.

The DPA had received a complaint from a citizen concerning Zagreb Holding's practice of requesting a copy of users' personal identification cards before issuing invoices via email. Previously, to receive invoice by email the users only needed to provide their name, surname, address, personal identification number, facility number and their user number. \r\n \r\nDuring the investigation, it was found that Zagreb Holding lacked established rules for identifying service users requesting invoice copies via email and only collected copies of identification documents when there was suspicion of false representation. The company requested personal identification document copies from users whose email addresses had a different name\/ structure than their name and surname, or if the user's name and surname in the email address did not match the requested invoice copy email address's structure. The DPA found that the mere inclusion of the correct name and surname in an email address is an insufficient protective measure. Consequently, the data controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures for user identification, contrary to Art. 25 (2) GDPR. According to the explanation given by the DPA, the data controller should have developed a process for identification via email ensuring a uniform procedure for all users, regardless of the email address structure.\r\nFurthermore, the data controller failed to transparently inform service users about the legal basis for collecting personal data (scan of personal identification card) for identification purposes.

The hotel was collecting personal data from guests in excess of what would have been necessary for the purpose of booking a hotel room and without a valid legal basis. Specifically, the hotel collected the CVC number of guests' credit cards and copies of their identification documents. The hotel also failed to provide clear and transparent information to guests on the collection and use of their data.\r\n \r\nThe hotel claimed it collected the CVC numbers of credit cards and even copies of personal identification document, when the booking was made via email, in order to prevent misuse of the credit cards.

Regardless of this, the hotel still requested provision of financial data (information on the credit card and CVC number). Taking into consideration that the booking was possible without provision of the CVC number, AZOP found that hotel did not have a legal basis for processing of such data.\r\n \r\nThe hotel also failed to provide clear and transparent information to guests on the collection and use of their data. Neither the hotel's general terms and conditions nor the form of consent for use of personal data provided sufficient information on circumstances of processing.

The DPA had received several complaints against IAB Europe since 2019. In the context of this complaint, the compliance of the 'Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF)' with the GDPR was mainly questioned. The TCF was developed by IAB to promote compliance with the GDPR by organizations using the OpenRTB protocol. \n\nThe OpenRTB protocol is a protocol for 'real-time bidding,' which is the automated online auction of user profiles for the sale and purchase of advertising space on the Internet. When users visit a website that contains an ad space, technology companies, through an automated auction system, can bid in real time for that ad space to display personalized advertising. \n\nWhen users visit a website for the first time, an interface appears through which they can consent to the collection and sharing of their personal information or object to various types of processing. \n\nAs part of the TCF, a consent management tool appears during this process. The tool allows the user to object to certain types of data processing. The TCF registers the user's preferences through the tool by generating a TC string and sends it to all partners participating in the OpenRTB system. Based on this TC string, user profiles are compiled, which are then passed on to advertisers. This makes it visible to them what kind of data processing the users have agreed to. \n\nWithin the scope of its investigation against IAB, the DPA identified a number of violations of the GDPR.\n\nIt found that the TC strings already constituted personal data and therefore IAB was required to have a legal basis for processing these data. However, IAB was unable to demonstrate any such legal basis.\n\nIn addition, IAB did not properly inform users about the functioning of the TCF. For example, the information provided to users was too generic and vague to understand the scope of the data processing. \n\nFurthermore, IAB had not maintained a register of its processing activities, had not appointed a data protection officer, as well as had not conducted a data protection impact assessment.","fine_amount":250000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting","gh_id":null,"et_id":"ETid-1051"},{"gh_direct_url":"","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-1052","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"Unlawful usage of video surveillance cameras which also monitored parts of the public space (violation of principle of data minimization).","fine_amount":900.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Individuals and Private Associations","gh_id":null,"et_id":"ETid-1052"},{"gh_direct_url":"","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-1054","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"The Italian DPA (Garante) fined ASL Latina EUR 10,000.

A caller could obtain extensive information on personal customer data from the company's customer service department simply by entering a customer's name and date of birth. In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low. Furthermore, according to the court, the violation was also rather minor, as it could not lead to a massive data leakage.","fine_amount":900000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting","gh_id":null,"et_id":"ETid-128"},{"gh_direct_url":"","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-1280","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"A police officer had unlawfully disclosed personal data of a drunk driving incident to the offender's mother during a chance encounter.

For this reason, the DPA found a violation of the principle of data minimization pursuant to Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR. \n\nThe DPA also found that the company had stored the vehicle data for an excessively long period of time. The data was kept for the duration of the business relationship with a customer and then for another three years after the termination of the vehicle rental. In addition, personal data of users who had been inactive for more than eight years were still stored in the company's databases.\n\nThe CNIL found that this long retention constituted a violation of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR. \n\nFinally, the DPA found that users were not adequately informed during the registration process on the company portal, and that the company thus violated Art. 12 GDPR.","fine_amount":175000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Transportation and Energy","gh_id":null,"et_id":"ETid-1318"},{"gh_direct_url":"","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-1319","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 600 on a private individual.

The DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 210 million for violations related to the provision of its Facebook service and EUR 180 million for violations related to the provision of its Instagram service. The Austrian organization 'None of Your Business' (NOYB) had filed a complaint with the DPA on behalf of two individuals. \n\nMeta had updated its terms of service shortly before the GDPR came into force. In its new terms of service, Meta informed its users to click 'Agree and Continue' to indicate their agreement with the new terms of service. This was required for further access to the services. Meta assumed that the acceptance of the updated terms of use constituted a contract between Meta and the user, since the processing of the data would be necessary for the provision as well as the improvement of the services. According to Meta, the data processing was therefore lawful pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant argued that Meta was actually trying to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing users' data. By making the access to its services conditional on users' consent to the updated terms of service, Meta was actually forcing users to consent to the processing of their personal data. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other European supervisory authorities concerned. The DPC found that Meta did not rely on user consent as a legal basis, and did not consider 'coerced consent' in this case. It also did not rule out the possibility that Meta relied on a contractual legal basis. In response, the DPC received objections from different supervisory authorities. However, the DPC found that Meta had breached its transparency obligations under the GDPR, by not clearly explaining to users for what purpose and on what legal basis their personal data would be processed. \n\nAs no agreement could be reached on the disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR. In its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by Meta. However, the EDPB took a different position than the DPC on the issue of the legal basis and found that Meta was not entitled to rely on a contractual legal basis. The EDPB therefore found that Meta had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR.

EUR 5.5 million. The Austrian organization 'None of Your Business' (NOYB) had filed a complaint with the DPA on behalf of an individual. \n\nWhatsApp had updated its terms of service shortly before the GDPR came into force. In its new terms of service, WhatsApp informed its users to click 'Agree and Continue' to indicate their agreement with the new terms of service. This was required for further access to the services. WhatsApp assumed that the acceptance of the updated terms of use constituted a contract between WhatsApp and the user, since the processing of the data would be necessary for the provision as well as the improvement of the services. According to WhatsApp, the data processing was therefore lawful pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant argued that WhatsApp was actually trying to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing users' data. By making the access to its services conditional on users' consent to the updated terms of service, WhatsApp was forcing users to consent to the processing of their personal data. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other European supervisory authorities concerned. The DPC found that WhatsApp did not rely on user consent as a legal basis, and did not consider 'coerced consent' in this case. It also did not rule out the possibility that WhatsApp relied on a contractual legal basis. In response, the DPC received objections from different supervisory authorities. However, the DPC found that WhatsApp had breached its transparency obligations under the GDPR, by not clearly explaining to users for what purpose and on what legal basis their personal data would be processed. \n\nAs no agreement could be reached on the disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR. In its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by WhatsApp. However, the EDPB took a different position than the DPC on the issue of the legal basis and found that WhatsApp was not entitled to rely on a contractual legal basis. The EDPB therefore found that WhatsApp had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR.

The controller collected copies of the bank cards with the intention of complying with requirements of the national Money Laundering Act. However, AZOP found that the collection of the copies was not necessary to comply with the requirements of the Money Laundering Act and that the processing of the data was therefore unlawful.\r\n\r\nIn this context, AZOP also found that the controller had not sufficiently informed the data subjects about the processing of their personal data, in particular, it was expressly stated that the data controller does not store bank card numbers and that the numbers are not accessible to the unauthorized persons. Accordingly, the information provided to the data subjects was missing information on the legal basis, purpose of collection and retention period of the personal data. \r\n\r\nThe controller also failed to take sufficient technical and organizational measures to protect personal data relating to the establishment of payment processes via Visa bank cards, as well as for the storage of data contained in the controller's databases. \r\n\r\nAs a result, in 2022 the controller collected copies of a total of 2078 bank cards, of which 655 copies were fully accessible. \r\n\r\nIn assessing the fine amount, AZOP took into account as an aggravating factor that financial data is particularly sensitive data and the controller therefore should have taken special measures to protect it. \r\n\r\nAs a mitigating circumstance, it was taken into account that the controller had announced that it would bring its processing procedures in line with the GDPR and had deleted all secured copies of the bank cards.","fine_amount":380000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Industry and Commerce","gh_id":null,"et_id":"ETid-1859"},{"gh_direct_url":"","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-186","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"The Italian supervisory authority imposed two fines totalling EUR 11,5 million on Eni Gas and Luce (Egl) for unlawful processing of personal data in the context of advertising activities and activation of unsolicited contracts.

Also, the controller had not adequately documented its personal data deletion procedures. \r\n\r\nPlease note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. \r\n\r\nUpdate: On February 12, 2021 the Aarhus District Court decided to impose a fine against IDdesign in the amount of EUR 13,450. With regard to the calculation of the fine, the court disagreed with the proposed amount of the fine. It concluded that the amount should be calculated on the basis of the company's own turnover and not that of the entire group. In addition, the court considered that the mitigating circumstances under Art. 83 (2) GDPR should be taken into account when calculating the fine. Such as that the company had not previously breached the GDPR, as well as that the breach concerned only general personal data. In addition, no data subject suffered damages as a result of the breach.

In response to a inquiry from the data subject as to where her new contact information came from, the controller informed her that its database was regularly updated using data obtained from the Spanish transport authority DGT (Direcci\u00f3n General de Tr\u00e1fico). As the data subject had not given consent for such processing of her data, she filed a complaint against the controller with the Spanish DPA. An investigation by the DPA revealed that the company had indeed entered into a contract with DGT. However, DGT had clarified that the purpose of the processing of contact data under the contract was to ensure the accuracy of the address when renewing a driver's license or when issuing medical reports so that it could be sent to the correct address. Nevertheless, the data subjects must request and consequently consent to such a change of address. Since these criteria were not met in the specific case, the DPA found a violation of the purpose limitation principle.","fine_amount":5000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Public Sector and Education","gh_id":null,"et_id":"ETid-597"},{"gh_direct_url":"","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-598","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 2,000 on Ordine degli Assistenti Sociali della Regione Lazio.

A visitor to the residence filed a complaint with the DPA. He based this on an installed video surveillance system in the accommodation. The video surveillance system recorded, among other things, the corridor connecting the accommodation with the communal showers. Moreover, the footage was not only recorded but also displayed in real time on the monitors of the concierge staff, creating the risk that the images could also be inadvertently seen by visitors or suppliers. During the course of the investigation, the institution's administration justified the installation of the video surveillance system by citing the need to prevent theft and ensure the health of residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic period. \n\nThe DPA found that the institute thereby violated the principles of lawfulness, transparency and data minimization. The fact that, as claimed by the institute, the passage of the guests to the shower rooms was filmed only occasionally and for a short duration, and that the quality of the recordings was not 'perfectly clear,' does not resolve the unlawfulness of the recordings. Also, the DPA noted that some procedural precautions - such as scheduling time windows to turn off the cameras to allow guests to visit the shower rooms without being filmed, or temporarily ensuring the security of the locations through alternative measures, such as the use of security personnel - may allow the institute to pursue the purpose of the video surveillance in an equally effective manner and avoid unjustifiably restricting the freedoms of the data subjects.\n\nFurthermore, the DPA found that the institute had not properly fulfilled its duty to inform.

A student had filed a complaint with the DPA about possible GDPR violations related to the use of a monitoring system during written exams. In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States; instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the  pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. \nEventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR.","fine_amount":200000.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Public Sector and Education","gh_id":null,"et_id":"ETid-876"},{"gh_direct_url":"","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-877","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined Sky Italia S.r.l. EUR 3,296,326 for illegal telemarketing. \nThe DPA's decision followed a complex investigation launched after dozens of reports and complaints from people who claimed that they received unsolicited promotional calls and promotional SMS both from Sky Italia directly and through call centers of other companies. \nIn this regard, the DPA found that the promotional calls were made without adequately informing the users (such as about the origin of the personal data transmitted to Sky Italia). Thus, data subjects would have had the opportunity to contact the company that collected the data and object to the processing.  Only after obtaining consent, Sky would then have been allowed to proceed with the commercial offers. \nSky used lists of data it had acquired from other companies for these promotional purposes. Contrary to Sky Italia's view, the consent to the disclosure of data to third parties given by the data subjects to the companies from which Sky Italia had acquired the lists did not authorize Sky Italia to use the data for its own promotional purposes.\nIn addition, Sky failed to verify the list of individuals who had objected to being contacted for advertising purposes before making the advertising calls. As a result, several data subjects had received advertising calls despite their explicit objection. Further, the DPA found that Sky had failed to properly appoint the suppliers of the lists as data processors. \nIn determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into aggravating consideration that the violations involved 'systemic' conduct that was rooted in the company's operations as well as the fact that Sky should have acquired sufficient experience and competence to make fundamental decisions in compliance with data protection regulations due to its ongoing contacts with the authority and its long-standing presence in the market.","fine_amount":3296326.0,"fine_currency":"EUR","sector":"Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting","gh_id":null,"et_id":"ETid-877"},{"gh_direct_url":"","et_direct_url":"https:\/\/www.enforcementtracker.com\/ETid-879","sources":[],"companies":[],"summary":"The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 70,000 on VODAFONE ESPA\u00d1A, S.A.U..
