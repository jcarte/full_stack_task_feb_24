Additionally, the company had not established and documented deadlines for deletion of personal data in their new CRM system.

Also, the controller had not adequately documented its personal data deletion procedures. \r\n\r\nPlease note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. \r\n\r\nUpdate: On February 12, 2021 the Aarhus District Court decided to impose a fine against IDdesign in the amount of EUR 13,450. With regard to the calculation of the fine, the court disagreed with the proposed amount of the fine. It concluded that the amount should be calculated on the basis of the company's own turnover and not that of the entire group. In addition, the court considered that the mitigating circumstances under Art. 83 (2) GDPR should be taken into account when calculating the fine. Such as that the company had not previously breached the GDPR, as well as that the breach concerned only general personal data. In addition, no data subject suffered damages as a result of the breach. Finally, the court considers that the negligent nature of the breach should be taken into account.",

The complaints were filed on 25th and 28th of May 2018 - immediately after the GDPR became applicable. The complaints concerned the creation of a Google account during the configuration of a mobile phone using the Android operating system. The CNIL imposed a fine of 50 million euros for lack of transparency (Art. 5 GDPR), insufficient information (Art. 13 \/ 14 GDPR) and lack of legal basis (Art. 6 GDPR). The obtained consents had not been given 'specific' and not 'unambigous' (Art. 4 nr. 11 GDPR).",

As to the first, sensitive user documents uploaded by rental candidates (including ID cards, health cards, tax notices, certificates issued by the family allowance fund, divorce judgments, account statements) were accessible online without any authentication procedure in place. Although the vulnerability was known to the company since March 2018, it was not finally resolved until September 2018. In addition, the company stored the documentation provided by candidates for longer than necessary. The CNIL took into account i.a. the seriousness of the breach (lack of due care in addressing vulnerability and the fact that the documents revealed very intimate aspects of users' lives), the size of the company and its financial standing.",

Video surveillance is therefore not proportionate to the purpose and not limited to what is necessary.
